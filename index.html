            <p class="lead">“A thousand years or more ago, 
                    When I was newly sewn,
                    There lived four wizards of renown,
                    Whose name are still well-known:
                    Bold Gryffindor from wild moor,
                    Fair Ravlenclaw from glen,
                    Sweet Hufflepuff from valley broad,
                    Shrewd Slytherin from fen.
                    They share a wish, a hope, a dream,
                    They hatched a daring plan,
                    To educate young sorcerers,
                    Thus Hogwarts school began.
                    Now each of these four founders
                    Formed their own house, for each
                    Did value different virtues,
                    In the ones they had to teach.
                    By Gryffindor, the bravest were
                    Prized far beyond the rest;
                    For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
                    Would always be the best;
                    For Hufflepuff, hardworkers were
                    Most worthy of admission;
                    And power-hungry Slytherin
                    Loved those of great ambition.
                    While still alive they did divide
                    Their favourates from the throng,
                    Yet how to pick the worthy ones
                    When they were dead and gone? 
                    'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
                    He whipped me off his head
                    The founders put some brains in me
                    So I could choose instead!
                    Now slip me snug around your ears,
                    I've never yet been wrong,
                    I'll have alook inside your mind 
                    And tell where you belong!” </p>
